instagram-download
==================

I quickly hacked this together to download your photos from Instagram since all the other web apps were overwhelmed with requests. This is a minimal approach that hosts a super basic web app that's hosted on your own machine.

Ironically, I used the following repo as a start: https://github.com/Instagram/python-instagram

To get it working. Just download the code and make sure you install the packages "python-instagram" and "bottle"

After that you should be able to just run "python instagram-download.py" and navigate to "http://localhost:8515/" to download your photos.
